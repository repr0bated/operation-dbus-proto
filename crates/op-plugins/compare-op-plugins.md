## Notes and Observations

- Local documentation files present: SPEC.md.
- Current implementation contains 29 Rust source files beyond the explicit spec/design source inventory.
- Root module declarations found in `lib.rs`/`main.rs`: auto_create, builtin, chat, dynamic_loading, plugin, registry, service_def, state, default_registry, state_plugins, state_publisher.
- 5 runtime dependencies are present in `Cargo.toml` but omitted from the SPEC dependency block.
