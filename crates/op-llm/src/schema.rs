//! Embedded plugin schema (single source of truth).
//!
//! The tched_router plugin in `op-plugins` is the **one** schema for LLM providers,
//! model routes, tools, and the selector contract — the plugin IS the schema.
//! op-llm does NOT declare a second, divergent schema. It **includes** the
//! plugin's schema here so the same definition is used in both places: the
//! plugin (authority, D-Bus/gRPC projection) and op-llm (provider adapters).
//!
//! Anything in op-llm that needs the provider/model/tool/route contract should
//! import it from this module, never re-define it.
