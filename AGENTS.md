# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to the AI agent when working with code in this repository.

## Mandatory skill preload — every agent and model

At the start of every session, before any analysis, planning, edits, or subagent work, read these four files completely:

- `.agents/skills/grpc-expert/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/grpc-protocol-expert/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/json-render/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/ovs-db-analysis/SKILL.md`

Mandatory even when the task does not mention these domains. Every subagent and model handoff must repeat the preload for its own session — a parent's preload does not count for a child. For OP-DBUS PluginSchema, generated plugin services, reflection, and seal/freeze/hot work, `grpc-expert` takes precedence over the generic `grpc-protocol-expert`; use the generic skill for protocol, channel, TLS, streaming, and observability concerns.

## Host-service policy (runit)

This server runs **Artix Linux with glibc**, not Chimera or a musl-based host.
Build and test the server for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. An installed musl
cross target or the Codex executable's own musl packaging does not change the
repository's native target. Any separate container portability test must name
its target and must not substitute for the Artix/glibc verification gate.

This host runs **runit** as PID 1. Manage services with `sudo sv <command> <service>` (e.g., `sudo sv restart op-grpc-bridge`). `sv` needs root to read `supervise/ok`.

- `/etc/runit/sv/<service>/run` is the service definition.
- Enabled by a symlink in `/etc/runit/runsvdir/default`.
- Update path: edit the `run` script or install a new binary, then `sudo sv restart <service>`.

Do not edit `/run/runit/service` directly. Do not invoke `runsv`/`runsvdir` by hand. **s6 is legacy**: `service6`, `s6-rc`, `s6-*`, `/run/service` are stale — treat any doc assuming them as historical. Note: `/usr/local/bin/systemctl` on this host is a shim that returns plausible answers — using it masks the deprecation; always use `sv`. Do not use `systemctl` or other foreign service-manager CLIs. Container/app deployment uses D-Bus via `busctl`.

## Xray configuration policy — mandatory

**Xray's live config must exist only at `/etc/xray/xray_config.json` inside the container.** Never point Xray at `/dev/shm/xray_config.json`, `/usr/local/etc/xray/config.json`, or any other disk-backed live path. The static bootstrap config is materialized at boot; the future model-generated generator replaces the same file atomically and reloads through D-Bus. Models must not write or reload Xray directly.

## Deployment (btrfs send/receive)

**Owner clarification (2026-09-13): there is no deployment script. Deployment
is btrfs send/receive of the prepared filesystem snapshot.** The release
boundary is the snapshot's contents and the send/receive transfer. Existing
`deploy/` scripts are source/history or preparation tooling; neither
`build-golden.sh` nor `btrfs-layout.sh` defines the current deployment mechanism.
Never hand-copy binaries onto a running host as a deploy step.

`deploy/runit/build-golden.sh` only populates and validates
`/opt/op-dbus/golden` from already built artifacts and an already sealed,
persisted catalog. Set `OP_PERSISTED_CATALOG_SOURCE` to use an isolated release
catalog; the script validates and copies it but never reseals it. It does not
create the read-only release snapshot, send
or receive it, activate a received filesystem, install files into the running
host, or restart services. `--golden-only` remains a compatibility alias for
its default behavior; the former `--live-only` and `--no-restart` modes are
retired. Snapshot creation, `btrfs send/receive`, target activation, and any
deliberate target service action are separate operator steps.

```sh
CXXFLAGS="-include cstdint" cargo build --workspace --release
sudo target/release/opblob seal-shm            # explicitly reseal after the build
sudo target/release/opblob persist             # retain the catalog across reboot
```

After builds, explicitly run the freshly built `opblob seal-shm`; bridge startup only consumes sealed blobs and never reseals. Use the service's schema-shaping environment when sealing: on this host, `sudo env COGNITIVE_MCP_QDRANT_URL=http://10.200.0.2:6334 target/release/opblob seal-shm` matches `deploy/runit/op-grpc-bridge/run`. Verify the live and persisted catalogs match after restart. Review catalog removals and keep a recoverable copy before a full reseal, which sweeps plugin IDs absent from the build.

The commands above describe build/catalog preparation, not deployment. Do not
infer a live install or restart from a successful build or snapshot preparation.
Network-critical services (OVS, uplink, DHCP, session bus) require deliberate
operator action; a learning or inventory pass never restarts them.

## Workspace shape and build

The workspace has **37 member crates under `crates/`, plus the root `op-dbus`
package** (38 workspace packages total). The root package has no application
binary. Binary targets live in members: for example `op-grpc-bridge` and
`op-grants-materializer` in `op-grpc-bridge`, `op-web-server` and `opdbus` in
`op-web`, `opblob` in `op-plugins`, and `op-runit-systemctl`/`svd` in
`op-runit-systemctl`. A binary target or runit directory is source inventory,
not proof that it is deployed; reconcile it with `enabled-services` and
`retired-services`. There is no `op-projection` crate. `[patch.crates-io]`
patches only `rovs-openflow` (vendored fork for OF1.5 `packet_type` match at
`vendor/rovs-openflow`). `op-ml`, `op-gallery-gen`, `op-uds-relay`, and
`zeroclaw-gui` have manifests under `crates/` but are outside workspace
membership; `op-ml` remains disabled for the ort API breakage (`#ml-fixme`).

**Rust-first: no new Python.** New automation, probes, and helpers go in Rust (`cargo run --bin <name> -p <crate> -- <args>`, a small binary in the relevant crate, or a `cargo-script`-style one-shot) or in shell + POSIX tools (`jq`, `curl`, `busctl`, `sv`). Do not add new `.py` files to the repo. Pre-existing scripts under `scripts/` (`export-llm-sessions-to-notebooklm-sources.py`, `or-fusion-archive.py`, `notebook-sources-cleanup.py`, etc.) are grandfathered — maintain them in place, don't propagate the pattern.

All cargo commands run from repo root:

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo check -p <crate>
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features
cargo test -p <crate> <test_name>
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

**Build gotchas**:
- **Release builds need `CXXFLAGS="-include cstdint"`** — vendored RocksDB in `cozorocks` fails on modern GCC without it.

**Frontend — single Vite app, external repo**:

The active UI lives in **`/srv/git/vercel-json-render-ui`** (not in this repo). It is a Vite + React app that op-web serves as static files from `/usr/local/share/op-dbus/dashboard/vercel-json-render/` at `http://10.0.0.1:8080/vercel-json-render/`.

```bash
# Build and deploy (from the UI repo)
cd /srv/git/vercel-json-render-ui && ./scripts/deploy-op-web.sh

# Dev server
cd /srv/git/vercel-json-render-ui && npm run dev
```

The script runs `npm run build -- --base /vercel-json-render/`, then rsyncs `dist/` into the static directory. op-web does **not** embed the UI via RustEmbed — it serves the deployed static files.

Fresh source exports also include the pinned UI source archive and verifier at
`vendor/vercel-json-render-ui/build-assets.sh`. That helper builds and checks the
captured UI without the sibling checkout or live rsync; golden preparation
stages only its validated asset archive and provenance manifest.

**Deprecated** (do not use for new work):
- `crates/op-web/ui/` (`zeroclaw-gui-repo`) — old RustEmbed path, no longer the active UI.
- `/srv/git/operation-dashboard-ui-07` — old operator console, superseded by `vercel-json-render-ui`.
- `crates/` dev dashboard (`crates/src/`) — legacy dev tooling.

**CI does NOT gate `cargo test` or `cargo clippy`** — never assume "CI green" means tests pass. The only CI code review is the Codex full-repo-review action (best-effort LLM pass, not a deterministic check).

## Conventional commits

`feat` / `fix` / `docs` / etc. with scoped `(<crate>)` and `!` for breaking changes (e.g., `feat(op-plugins)!:`, `fix(mcp):`). Convention only — no enforced hook.

## Verify before marking done

Run `/verify` before reporting work complete. CI won't catch fmt drift, clippy warnings, or test regressions, so the agent must. `/verify` runs `cargo fmt --all -- --check` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` + `cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features`.

## Architecture — the load-bearing invariants (read these before touching plugins, state, or identity)

- **D-Bus is the only control plane.** Every plugin is a D-Bus object at `/org/opdbus/v1/plugins/<name>` under `org.opdbus.v1`. No `Command::new(...)` subprocesses, no direct file reads for live state, no polling loops in plugin/service code. New backend capabilities register as plugins in `crates/op-plugins/src/default_registry.rs` — never as new gRPC proto service packages.
- **The plugin IS the schema — one source of truth, nonnegotiable.** That single schema is sealed into the blob, which IS the plugin. D-Bus method signatures, MCP tool inputs, gRPC shapes, and UI field renderers derive from it. Validate inputs against it. Each plugin defines its schema under `crates/op-plugins/src/state_plugins/`, using `plugin_scaffold_helpers.rs`. **There must be no parallel plugin schema source in a repository-level or plugin `schemas/` directory.** The former plugin capture directories, separate section files, and JSON-file loader have been removed. `crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/schema_loader.rs` still exists by name, but it reads only a manifest-pinned `PluginSchema` from the sealed blob catalog; it is not a file-schema fallback. The tched_router upstream document is imported once into `tched_router_contract.rs`; `tched_router_config_surface.rs` and its methods derive from that plugin-owned contract. Importing a new binary schema must replace that embedded contract through `gen_tched_router_config_surface --import-json`; it must not create a second captured-schema authority. Older docs claiming a single `plugin_schema_defs.rs` are also stale — that file does not exist. Owner reaffirmed this rule on 2026-09-13.
- **The sealed blob IS the plugin.** Present state lives in the sealed blob catalog at `/dev/shm/opdbus/plugin-blobs/<plugin_id>.<schema_hash16>.blob`. A plugin exists ⟺ its blob is in the catalog. The sole writer is the blob sealer in `op-blob`. Consumers read SHM directly (zero-copy) — they never re-hash and never consult the Rust registry for existence. The old `/dev/shm/opdbus/schemas` folder and `live-schema.json` are gone.
- **MutationEngine owns state; streaming comes from SHM (owner reaffirmed 2026-09-13).** MutationEngine folds authoritative backend results into the complete state tree, including child objects, and commits that state to canonical SHM before change notifications. Child updates/deletions must preserve unrelated children and parent fields. Existing subscriptions derive their values from committed SHM; an in-memory event payload, method argument, or generator buffer is not a second state authority. Preserve verified principal/session scope for private state. Do not add a separate per-method streaming control plane or claim a buffered unary response provides state streaming.
- **MCP gateway (settled).** One public MCP door: `:8090` on `op-grpc-bridge` (cognitive MCP is in-process there; no standalone `op-cognitive-mcp` runit service). `compact_mcp` is a retired plugin id. Compact *mode* (4 meta-tools) is in-process in op-web for the singleton control-plane chatbot; it is not an MCP plugin and not a second listener. Never create new shims or point external clients at `op-assistant-grpc`.
- **External binaries back plugins; the plugin remains the single schema source.** 3tched-router / tched-router (`tched_router` in code) is the framework/schema/plugin integration backed by the autonomous `/usr/bin/zeroclaw` executable. The reproducible native input is pinned in `vendor/tched-router/source.pin`; `vendor/tched-router/build-native.sh` applies the checked-in patches and emits `target/native-artifacts/tched-router/{zeroclaw,manifest.json}` without installing it. `build-golden.sh` validates the pin, patch and binary provenance, then stages the binary, manifest, `/etc/op-dbus/zeroclaw-runtime.toml`, and the tracked default skill bundle into the golden filesystem. The `zeroclaw` runit service verifies that manifest, exact commit, binary digest, and version before exec, then seeds its private runtime config and skills from those staged bootstrap files. A fresh checkout includes the digest-pinned upstream source archive, patches and build recipe; the helper verifies and uses that archive by default. Cargo registry dependencies and system build tools still need provisioning. The executable keeps its upstream name. The plugin contract remains `tched_router_contract.rs`, and source attribution may identify `zeroclaw config schema`.
- **Owner-confirmed lifecycle and model roles (2026-09-13, reaffirmed 2026-09-14).** Waypipe is retired: its crate directory, Cargo membership, binary target and protocol are absent; `retired-binaries`/`retired-services` prevent stale build or service artifacts from entering golden. Do not restore it in source exports or release inputs. Assistant is the control-plane chatbot, not an `assistant` container. The historical Gemma routing role is model agnostic; the `op-gemma` package name does not constrain the model/provider. Cargo membership and legacy names do not establish active deployments.
- **Factory role correction (2026-09-14).** The former Factory account/platform plugin is retired from the registry and dispatch. The intended access is CLI/SSH; routing belongs to `tched_router`, and Factory billing requires an actual native binding. Provider names or relabelled direct upstream routes do not prove that binding. A future Missions integration needs its own verified native contract; do not restore the retired REST platform methods from historical fixtures or docs.
- **Standalone vendor adapters are retired (2026-09-14).** The `op-grpc-adapters` crate directory and its `op.adapters.v1` protocol are absent after Netmaker retirement. Its duplicate mail/MQ services bypassed canonical plugin admission. Do not restore this crate or its old Netmaker clients. The existing bridge `operation.mail.v1` service and retained EMQX plugin are separate surfaces; their presence does not prove every mail or MQTT method is implemented.
- **Owner-confirmed network topology (2026-09-13).** There is no WireGuard on this server. WireGuard terminates at the decoy; identity is transported by WARP. WireGuard types, plugin declarations, credentials or historical configuration paths in source do not establish a server WireGuard interface or a requirement to install one. Classify those surfaces by their decoy/server role before proposing implementation or retirement. An unwired `wgcf` method is not evidence that the actual WARP identity transport is broken.
- **Identity minting and metadata (owner reaffirmed 2026-09-13).** The identity subsystem owns minting the identity and its SealedId/SID1 credential blob. This is distinct from an OPBLOB01 plugin blob and does not belong in the plugin catalog. Clients forward the authored credential through the transport's identity metadata; they do not mint or reconstruct it from genesis/trace/key headers. Verify minting, persistence, injection and receiver validation as separate links. Current source assigns session/SID1 creation to MutationEngine with the op-identity format; the existence of an HTTP/MCP helper does not prove every gRPC client injects SID1.
- **Btrfs is transport, not backup/restore.** Deployment is the prepared snapshot transferred by `btrfs send/receive`, not a deployment script. Subvolume count must stay at **5 or fewer**: 1 golden for send/receive, 2-3 rotating for cache. Despite historical member names such as `timing_subvol`, Snowball `timing/`, `vectors/`, `state/`, and `snapshots/` are ordinary directories inside its data root and never create child subvolumes. `deploy/btrfs-layout.sh` only checks the filesystem and mount point; it does not define or create a backup hierarchy. Historical layouts or script names do not authorize extra subvolumes or a different deployment mechanism.
- **No SQLite — use CozoDB.** CozoDB (`op-cozo-store`) is the embedded database for this project. Do not add new `rusqlite` or other SQLite use. `op-cache/src/btrfs_cache.rs` already uses a Cozo index; current `workstack_cache.rs`, `workflow_cache.rs`, `workflow_tracker.rs`, and `pattern_tracker.rs` still use `rusqlite` and remain migration debt rather than an approved pattern.

## Signals and task board

- **Append observations to `SIGNALS.md`** rather than letting them evaporate in chat. Three signal types: `💡 SUGGESTION` · `⚠️ CONCERN` · `👁️ OBSERVATION`. Each row: date · model · signal · optional `→ OD-##` link. Models leave status `open`. Promote anything actionable to `WISHLIST.md` as an `OD-##` and link it back.
- **`WISHLIST.md` is the canonical task board** — do not create new TODO docs. Priority buckets: Critical/Urgent → Current → Next → Future → When I Have Staff. Dispatch syntax: "dispatch <ID> to <agent>" spawns an agent with the task context and updates status here.
- **Read recent `SIGNALS.md` rows before non-trivial work** in the area they touch — the file records load-bearing gotchas (stale vendored deps, live/deployed drift, the live-vs-intent identity topology) that source alone will not surface.

## Stale documentation

- **README.md is stale**: crate count (31) is wrong, `cd lovable` is a deleted directory, `sudo service6` references are retired. Prefer AGENTS.md and source over README claims.
- Many older deploy scripts and HANDOFF docs still reference s6 — treat them as archival; runit/`sv` is current.
- Anything mentioning `/dev/shm/plugin_schema.dat`, `live-schema.json`, or `/dev/shm/opdbus/schemas` is describing a retired design.
- Anything mentioning `OIB1`, `oib1:`, `blob_ref`, `SessionIdentityBlob`, or `x-opdbus-identity-blob-bin` is pre-2026-09-01 and stale; the session-identity envelope is now `SID1` / `SealedId`.
- Anything referencing `crates/op-web/ui/` as the active UI, or `operation-dashboard-ui-07` as the operator console — the active UI is `/srv/git/vercel-json-render-ui`, deployed via its `scripts/deploy-op-web.sh`.
- Older deployment-script and backup/restore hierarchy descriptions are not current deployment authority. Deployment is btrfs send/receive of the prepared snapshot — see architecture invariants above.

## Subagent and model selection

**Owner preference (2026-09-13): assess task difficulty and required reasoning
before delegation, and use the cheapest available model that can complete it
reliably. Do not inherit an expensive parent model by default.** For the current
model pool, use the low-cost `gpt-5.6-luna` for lookups, inventory extraction,
documentation assembly, builds/tests and routine checks; choose low effort for
mechanical work and medium effort for bounded reasoning. Escalate only when
specific complexity or a failed attempt warrants it, and briefly state why.

Keep the primary agent available for user communication and coordination.
Delegate longer execution/research jobs, use nonblocking progress checks, and
avoid long blocking tool calls on the primary. User messages steer active work;
answer them promptly while delegated work continues. Small immediate edits and
decisions can remain with the primary when delegation would add overhead.

Prefer the **least-expensive subagent that preserves quality** for builds and tests:

- `Explore` (fast read-only) for locating code, grepping symbols, answering "where is X."
- `Plan` for architecture/design before writing code.
- `general-purpose` only when the task needs multi-step reasoning or execution that Explore/Plan cannot cover.
- Reserve expensive model overrides (Opus-class) for tasks that genuinely require them — complex cross-crate reasoning, security review, or ambiguous architectural decisions. Standard edits, build fixes, and test work belong on the default agent.
- Do not spawn a subagent for a single-file edit or a direct grep you can do yourself.
