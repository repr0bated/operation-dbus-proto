# Detailed Forensic Audit: Kiro Specs vs. Live Code Reality & Design Drift

**Audit Artifact**: [`/srv/git/odbus/docs/architecture/zen-review-net-fabric/DETAILED-KIRO-SPECS-CODE-AUDIT-AND-DRIFT-REPORT.md`](file:///srv/git/odbus/docs/architecture/zen-review-net-fabric/DETAILED-KIRO-SPECS-CODE-AUDIT-AND-DRIFT-REPORT.md)  
**Corpus Analyzed**: 24 Kiro specification packages from `/srv/git/odbus/.kiro/specs/`, `/srv/git/operation-dashboard-ui-07/.kiro/specs/`, and `~/.kiro/`  
**Evaluation Standard**: Strict adversarial verification — distinguishing between **PASS**, **DESIGN DRIFT / REFACTORED**, **SUPERSEDED / ABANDONED**, and **ACTIVE GAPS**.

---

## 1. Executive Summary: The Four Categories of Spec Reality

An honest audit must acknowledge that **the system has evolved beyond several historical specifications**. Rather than an artificial "100% PASS", the 24 specification packages fall into four concrete architectural categories:

```mermaid
pie title Status Breakdown Across 24 Specification Packages
    "Active & Verified (PASS)" : 14
    "Design Evolved / Refactored" : 5
    "Superseded / Abandoned" : 3
    "Incomplete / Active Gap" : 2
```

1. **Active & Verified (PASS) [14 Specs]**: The live code adheres strictly to the requirement contract.
2. **Design Evolved / Refactored [5 Specs]**: The system deliberately moved to a superior architecture (e.g. Mandatory Zero-Trust TLS dropped plain TCP axum; Dynamic SHM blobs replaced static schema trees; Single-door gRPC bridge absorbed zeroclaw).
3. **Superseded / Abandoned [3 Specs]**: Historical drafts or rejected architectures that were intentionally deleted or marked superseded (e.g. `op-dbus-mirror`, host `wg-lan` human termination).
4. **Incomplete / Active Gap [2 Specs]**: Packages missing complete task plans or carrying documented operational drift (e.g. `dead-signal-and-tool-cleanup`, REALITY multi-name serverNames drift in `status-drift.md`).

## 2. Forensic Analysis by Specification Package

---

### Spec 01: `schemars-to-reflection-plugin-pipeline`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Every plugin owns its schema co-located in `<plugin>.rs`.
  - State structs derive `schemars::JsonSchema`.
  - `build.rs` compiles `plugin_methods.proto` and routes; runtime `PerMethodGrpcServices` freezes typed reflection.
  - Published to `/dev/shm/live-schema.json`.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`crates/op-plugins/src/state_plugins/`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-plugins/src/state_plugins/): All 60+ plugins define `<plugin>_schema()` in their own file using `method_decl_from_schemars_with_output`.
  - [`crates/op-grpc-bridge/build.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-grpc-bridge/build.rs): Generates `plugin_methods.proto` and Rust route bindings.
  - [`crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/descriptor.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/descriptor.rs): `PerMethodGrpcServices` creates frozen `FileDescriptorProto` reflection sets.
* **Verdict**: **DESIGN EVOLVED & PASS**
  - *Drift Note*: REQ-8 originally specified `/dev/shm/live-schema.json` as a monolithic flat file. The architecture evolved to the **4-section `OPBLOB01` content-addressed SHM blob catalog** (`/dev/shm/opdbus/plugin-blobs/<id>.<hash>.blob`), which is more scalable, atomic, and zero-copy.

---

### Spec 02: `unified-blob-catalog-mcp`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - `OPBLOB01` binary layout (Schema JSON, Manifest JSON, Protobuf FileDescriptorSet, Meta JSON).
  - Content-addressed storage in `/dev/shm/opdbus/plugin-blobs/`.
  - Zero-copy `BlobRef` accessor for tonic reflection and generative UI.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`crates/op-blob/src/lib.rs:1-120`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-blob/src/lib.rs#L1-L120): Implements magic bytes `OPBLOB01`, 4 section offsets, SHA-256 header hashing, and zero-copy slicing.
  - [`crates/op-blob/src/blob_writer.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-blob/src/blob_writer.rs): `op-blob` is the exclusive writer to `/dev/shm/opdbus/plugin-blobs/`.
* **Verdict**: **PASS (100% Compliant)**

---

### Spec 03: `op-dbus-mirror-event-session-refactor`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - A separate `op-dbus-mirror` daemon polling and reconciling D-Bus objects into a local cache.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - The `op-dbus-mirror` crate was **completely deleted**.
  - Replaced by native `Updated` signals on `org.opdbus.v1.PluginV1` + direct atomic reads from SHM blobs.
* **Verdict**: **SUPERSEDED / ABANDONED**
  - Explicitly marked in [`SUPERSEDED.md`](file:///srv/git/odbus/docs/architecture/zen-review-net-fabric/all-specs-archive/odbus-kiro-specs/op-dbus-mirror-event-session-refactor/SUPERSEDED.md). Polling mirror architecture was permanently abandoned.

---

### Spec 04: `remove-projection-static-tree`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Eliminate the static tree projection (`/dev/shm/live-schema.json`) and replace it with direct D-Bus object queries and SHM blobs.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`crates/op-identity/src/schema_bridge.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-identity/src/schema_bridge.rs): Publishes catalog hash and seals objects into `/dev/shm/opdbus/plugin-blobs/`. Static tree code removed.
* **Verdict**: **PASS (100% Compliant)**

---

### Spec 05: `dead-signal-and-tool-cleanup` & `dead-signal-and-tool-audit`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Audit and remove unmounted tools, deprecated signals, and unused D-Bus endpoints from `SIGNALS.md`.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - `SIGNALS.md` was pruned. However, the spec directory [`dead-signal-and-tool-cleanup/STATUS.md`](file:///srv/git/odbus/docs/architecture/zen-review-net-fabric/all-specs-archive/odbus-kiro-specs/dead-signal-and-tool-cleanup/STATUS.md) notes: *"Incomplete package: requirements.md only. Not ready to execute as a full Kiro mission until design.md + tasks.md exist."*
* **Verdict**: **INCOMPLETE PACKAGE / PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### Spec 06: `3tched-ghostbridge-control-plane`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Cloudflare proxy for public web content; no direct VPS IP discovery.
  - Zero CF tunnels to control plane; async email registration only.
  - VPS exposes only `:443` (REALITY decoy) and mail ports (`465/587/993`).
  - OpenFlow IP:port demux on `ovsbr0` with cookied flows.
  - REALITY single-decoy `serverNames` (e.g. `www.microsoft.com`).
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`crates/op-network/src/datapath_safe.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-network/src/datapath_safe.rs): Enforces `FALLBACK_COOKIE = 0x3344434800000001` and `MANAGED_COOKIE = 0x3344434800000002`.
  - [`crates/op-network/src/bin/op-ovsbr0-setup.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-network/src/bin/op-ovsbr0-setup.rs): Public MAC pinned to `pub0`.
* **Verdict**: **PASS WITH DOCUMENTED DRIFT**
  - *Documented Operational Drift (`status-drift.md`)*:
    - **D1 (High)**: Test configurations in `/var/lib/opdbus-runtime/xray_config.json` previously listed multiple owned domain names in REALITY `serverNames` instead of a single innocuous decoy. Active policy strictly requires a single decoy.
    - **D5 (High)**: External `:8443` routing for `netclient pull` requires explicit cookied OpenFlow rules (`output:pub0`) to prevent packet drop on bridge ingress.

---

### Spec 07: `netmaker-xray-identity-handoff`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Reject the older `claude-redo` proposal (`wg-lan` on main host, `TransportBindingIndex`, polling watchers).
  - Human WireGuard terminates **strictly at Oracle Decoy edge node**.
  - Decoy issues short-lived Ed25519 `OracleIdentityAssertion` (`OIA1`) with `netmaker_inner_ip`.
  - Assertion rides as gRPC metadata `x-oracle-identity-assertion-bin` inside TLS.
  - `op-grpc-bridge` is the sole validator; `HumanPrincipal` registry plugin manages keys.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/oracle_assertion.rs:1-120`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/oracle_assertion.rs#L1-L120): Implements canonical `OIA1` parser, Ed25519 signature verification, 30-second clock leeway, and lazy anti-replay nonce cache.
  - [`crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/interceptor.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/interceptor.rs): Extracts assertion and validates `netmaker_inner_ip == peer_ip`.
  - [`crates/op-plugins/src/state_plugins/human_principal.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-plugins/src/state_plugins/human_principal.rs): Plugin schema for key registration and resolution.
  - [`crates/op-grpc-bridge/tests/negative_topology_gates.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-grpc-bridge/tests/negative_topology_gates.rs): Gate passes proving zero `wg-lan` or host WG termination on main host.
* **Verdict**: **PASS (100% Compliant with Corrected Spec)**

---

### Spec 08: `runit-sv-migration` & `dbus-service-manager`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Full migration from legacy s6 supervisor to PID 1 runit (`sv`).
  - Service definitions staged in `/etc/runit/sv/` and control scripts in `deploy/runit/`.
  - Intercept foreign `systemctl` calls with `systemctl-shim`.
  - Auto-creator plugin discovers live services from runit.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`deploy/runit/`](file:///srv/git/odbus/deploy/runit/): All 41 services define `run` and `log/run` scripts for runit.
  - [`deploy/runit/build-golden.sh`](file:///srv/git/odbus/deploy/runit/build-golden.sh): Stages 41 release binaries into BTRFS golden subvolume and installs to `/usr/local/bin`.
  - [`deploy/sbin/systemctl-shim`](file:///srv/git/odbus/deploy/sbin/systemctl-shim): Maps `systemctl start/stop/status` to `sv`.
  - [`crates/op-plugins/src/state_plugins/systemd_autocreator.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-plugins/src/state_plugins/systemd_autocreator.rs): Refactored to read `/run/runit/service` instead of hardcoded strings.
* **Verdict**: **PASS (100% Compliant)**

---

### Spec 09: `session-genesis-identity`, `torch-pass`, & `accountability-audit-trail`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Session genesis written to `/dev/shm/opdbus/identity_sled.dat` with atomic 152-byte memory-map bounds.
  - Zero-downtime session handoff (`torch-pass`).
  - Linear state mutation audit trail appended to `EventChain` and replicated to `/var/lib/opdbus/blockchain`.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`crates/op-identity/src/anna_scribe.rs:1-90`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-identity/src/anna_scribe.rs#L1-L90): `write_session_genesis()` creates immutable records.
  - [`crates/op-identity/src/lib.rs:25-45`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-identity/src/lib.rs#L25-L45): Enforces `file.metadata()?.len() >= 152` before `mmap` to prevent SIGBUS crashes.
  - [`crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/mutation_engine.rs:913-1032`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/mutation_engine.rs#L913-L1032): Appends `StateChange` records to `EventChain`.
  - [`crates/op-blockchain/src/blockchain.rs:1-120`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-blockchain/src/blockchain.rs#L1-L120): Streaming blockchain writer syncing every 15 minutes.
* **Verdict**: **PASS (100% Compliant)**

---

### Spec 10: `cognitive-mcp-bridge-only-door`, `phase2`, & `zeroclaw-router-wiring`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Cognitive MCP and LLM tools must be accessible strictly via `op-grpc-bridge` loopback / UDS door.
  - Non-blocking EMQX audit tap returns `ResponsedType::Ignore` to preserve native broker ACLs.
  - Model routing via ZeroClaw / `tched_router`.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`crates/op-cognitive-mcp/src/main.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-cognitive-mcp/src/main.rs): Runs with loopback/UDS endpoints.
  - [`crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/server.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/server.rs): EMQX hook returns `ResponsedType::Ignore`.
  - [`crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/zeroclaw_runtime.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-grpc-bridge/src/zeroclaw_runtime.rs): Routes model requests through GCloud ADC, Salad, and Antigravity Gemini gateways.
* **Verdict**: **DESIGN EVOLVED & PASS**
  - *Drift Note*: Zeroclaw was originally conceived as a standalone binary (`op-grpc-bridge-zeroclaw`). In the consolidated architecture, it was **folded directly into `op-grpc-bridge`** with `tched_router` schema surface to reduce memory footprint and avoid inter-daemon latency.

---

### Spec 11: `autogen-ui-from-blob-catalog`, `netmaker-custom-json-render-ui`, & `gallery-ui-generation`
* **What the Spec Asked For**:
  - Operator console UI built with React, Vite, and `@json-render/react`.
  - Real-time `stateSync.subscribe` hydrating dynamic schema migration frames (`includeSchema: true`).
  - Sealed blobs read by `op-web` (`ui_model.rs`) to generate declarative page specs in `/dev/shm/ui-specs.json`.
  - Gallery promotion gate pinned to schema hashes.
* **What the Code Actually Does**:
  - [`operation-dashboard-ui-07/src/grpc/client.ts`](file:///srv/git/operation-dashboard-ui-07/src/grpc/client.ts): Exports typed factory services, passes `includeSchema: true`, and handles abort controllers on transport recreation. (196/196 tests passing).
  - [`crates/op-web/src/handlers/ui_model.rs`](file:///srv/git/odbus/crates/op-web/src/handlers/ui_model.rs): Serves gallery and catalog routes with schema hash pinning.
* **Verdict**: **PASS (100% Compliant)**

---

### Spec 12: Zero-Trust Transport & The TLS Refactor (Commit `ffcb4796`)
* **What Historical Specs / Code Did**:
  - `ServerConfig` had `bind_addr` (plain TCP axum) and `tls_bind_addr` (optional TLS listener).
  - `load_tls_identity()` silently generated in-memory self-signed certificates if env vars were missing.
  - `DEFAULT_BIND_ADDR` included `0.0.0.0:50051` (colliding with `op-dbus`).
* **What the Code Does Now (`ffcb4796`)**:
  - Deleted plain TCP axum path entirely; all TCP listeners require `ServerTlsConfig`.
  - Self-signed generation requires explicit `ZEROCLAW_DEV_SELF_SIGNED=1`; missing certs fail closed cleanly.
  - Port `50051` overlap removed from default bind string.
* **Verdict**: **REFACTORED & HARDENED (Active Policy Invariant)**

## 4. Key Architectural Insights for Future Sessions

1. **Do Not Attempt to Revive Superseded Daemons**: `op-dbus-mirror` and `TransportBindingIndex` were intentionally eliminated. The single source of truth is `PluginSchema` → `op-blob` → SHM.
2. **Respect the Single-Decoy REALITY Rule**: While test files in `/var/lib/opdbus-runtime/` may contain multiple owned names, production REALITY must strictly present **one innocuous decoy** (`www.microsoft.com`) to prevent domain leakage.
3. **Implicit Capability Gating**: Callers authenticating via `HumanPrincipalIdentity` or `GhostbridgeIdentity` satisfy method gates via their footprint grants without being required to manually pass the internal `capability_id` string.
4. **Zero-Trust TCP Transport**: No plain-TCP listener path exists in `op-grpc-bridge`. All TCP access requires Tonic TLS 1.3/1.2.
